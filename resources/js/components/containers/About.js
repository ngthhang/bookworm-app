            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>The name Bookworm was taken from the original nam for New York International Airport, which was renamed JFK in December 1963.</p>
            <p>Our Manhattan store has just moved to the West Village. Our new localtion is 170 7th Avenue South, at the corner of Perry Street.</p>
            <p>From March 2008 through May 2016, the store was located in the Flatiron District.</p>

            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <p>One of the last travel bookstores in the country, our Manhattan store carries a range of guidebooks (all 10% off) to suit the needs and tastes of every traveler and budget.</p>
            <p>We belive that a novel or travelogue can be just as valuable a key to a place as any guidebook, and our well-read, well-traveled staff is happy to make reading recommendations for any traveler, book lover, or gift giver.</p>
